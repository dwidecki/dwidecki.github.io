#Welcome to my project page!

Below are some of my recent projects.

#SER225 Game
This is a 2D platform game that was already created and my team and I were tasked with making many notable enhancements and bug fixes. The program was written entirely in Java. Some of my contributions to the game include enemy and water bug fixes as well as new designs and in game elements such as dog enemies etc.

The URL for the repo is -- https://github.com/mattcmerritt/Team-A1-SER-225-Game

#Vending Machine
This is a short program that I collaborated on with a team member that imitates the process of using a vending machine such as choosing a snack, computing a total, cancel/confirm transactions. This program was written entirely in Java. I enjoyed this project because I feel the way my team member and I alternated through the tasks we wanted to implement was seamless.
